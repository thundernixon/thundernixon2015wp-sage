                <h4 class="small-caps">FAQ</h4>
                <p>“Is your middle name really ‘Thunder’?”</p>
                <p>
                  Nope. Back in high school, at one of the many points in life I decided to double-down on being weird, I decided that my nick name would be "Thunder," because it was the first melodramatic, funny thing that came to mind. Shortly thereafter, I was signing up for Twitter, Email, domain names, and more, so it became an easy way to be found online. Really, try Googling "Stephen Thunder Nixon." It works too well to drop!
