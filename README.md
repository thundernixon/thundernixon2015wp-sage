#Project Summary

In this project, I'm experimenting to learn new technologies, with the end goal of creating a new personal website and portfolio. If I don't use this project to create a finished portfolio, it will be because I've ended up learning some good lessons from the experiment, and have started over with a new project.

##Sage

For this project, I am basing the website off of WordPress, using the Sage starter theme:

"Sage is a WordPress starter theme based on HTML5 Boilerplate, gulp, Bower, and Bootstrap Sass, that will help you make better themes."
